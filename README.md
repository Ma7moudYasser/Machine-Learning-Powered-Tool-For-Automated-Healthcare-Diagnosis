Motivation (2)

The early detection of diseases can significantly improve healthcare outcomes. Machine learning algorithms excel at processing massive datasets and uncovering hidden patterns, making them ideal for disease prediction. This study aims to contribute to this field by investigating the performance of the Naive Bayes algorithm in predicting diabetes risk.

## Proposed Model (3)

We propose a disease prediction tool that utilizes the Naive Bayes algorithm. While this initial implementation focuses on Naive Bayes for its simplicity, we plan to explore incorporating multiple algorithms for a hybrid model in the future. Our model aims to:

Achieve higher accuracy compared to existing disease prediction tools.
Include a diverse collection of diseases.
Be user-friendly and require no special instructions.
Challenges (3)

The success of this model heavily relies on high-quality datasets. Limited resources currently pose a challenge in gathering suitable data. We are confident that advancements in the field will provide access to more comprehensive datasets in the future.

Naive Bayes Algorithm (3.1)

The Naive Bayes algorithm is a classifier based on Bayes' theorem, a fundamental concept in probability theory. It calculates the probability of an event considering its prior probability and the evidence's impact.

## Steps Involved (3.2)

User Input: The user selects 4-5 symptoms from a predefined list.
Algorithm Application: The algorithm processes the user input and searches for the most probable disease based on the dataset's probabilities.
Output Display: The most likely disease is displayed on the screen.
Error Handling: If no input is provided, a prompt reminds the user to enter data.
Conclusion

This study investigates the potential of the Naive Bayes algorithm for disease risk prediction. The tool's effectiveness has significant implications for both researchers and healthcare professionals. Future work will explore hybrid models and incorporate a broader range of diseases.
